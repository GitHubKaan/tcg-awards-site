## How it works:
1. Copy the values from _.env.example_ into _.env.dev_ and _.env.prod_, and adjust them to match your development and production environments.
2. Run `npm i` to install all dependencies.
3. Run `npm audit fix` to fix all dependencie issues (if there are any).
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the application in development mode. This will use the _.env.dev_ configuration.
5. Run `npm run build` to create a production build of the frontend. This process uses the _.env.prod_ configuration.
6. After the build is complete, you can find the final frontend files in the _/build_ directory.
7. Done.

> [!NOTE]  
> Some dependencies cannot be fixed automatically with `npm audit fix`. In that case, please review the audit log for more details and recommended next steps.

## Pages:
All paths can be found inside the _App.tsx_ file.
